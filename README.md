# Memory Game Project

## What is a Memory Game?

It's a fun way to train your mind by laying down a group of cards and flipping them over to reveal its content.

You can flip a maximum of two cards, if their content match they are permanently displayed. Otherwise, you have to flip them back (no worries! the game itself will do it for you :D )

## Instructions

* Click a card and memorize its position and figure.
* Click a second card, if it matches the first, it will stay displayed, if not, both will be hidden again.
* The game will finish once all pairs are discovered.

## How it's made?

Starting code giving by Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

During the first part of the course they taught us how to create a responsive website and then, how to integrate HTML & CSS with JS.

Concepts applied:

* DOM
* Content Creation with JS
* Event listeners
* Array, For loops, variable declaration, functions.

## Functions created in JS

* Suffle() (given by Udacity and taken for Stackoverflow)
* Initgame ()
* addFlipCard()
* setRating()
* endGame()
* compareCard()
* initTime()
* resetTimer()

## Stay udacious, have fun and keep learning!!!
